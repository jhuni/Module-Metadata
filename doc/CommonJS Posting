I see no problem with require as long as it isn't being used to create multiple blocking IO requests. As such I developed some tools which might be useful to someone:

Features for Modules/1.1.1 users: 
- an optional requires[] key which lets you assist static-analysis tools by informing them of shallow-deps.

- implicit metadata: a script which will build metadata for a commonjs script that isn't directly expressed, this essentially gets all instances of requires() that have string literals to build a requires[] key, this is useful because once a script has metadata in the proper format it can be handled.

Meta Handlers:
These are functions(){} in which handle data (such as requires[]), and use it to do interesting things. 

I have implented a meta handler "bundler" in which takes any script with its metadata properly defined and it concats all of its dependencies to build a standalone file, a file that is independent of the META() system and independent of any loaders.

I have implemented the transport formats as meta handlers.
