This is a proposal to store metadata about individual modules similar to how META.json stores metadata about packages.

I think this is a superior system to using require, because require doesn't have the same level of accessibility, extensibility, and configurability as JSON. The require proposal just tries to port a statement from popular server-side languages such as Perl and Python to JavaScript rather then building a JavaScripty solution, and it uses a hacked together regular expression trick to make it work well on the client side. 

This metadata system puts client side performance first and foremost rather then making it some sort of afterthought, all operations in this metadata system are strictly non-blocking and combo loading is used consistently.

Additionally, you can easily define your own metadata format using META handlers. For example if you want a good way of loading CSS or some other file format, META handlers will make that process easy.
