Metaprogramming:
The ClojureScript programming language provides the following namespace system:

(ns js.sample.api
  (:require [goog.dom :as dom]
            [goog.style :as style]))

JSON can be used to describe all of the same data structures that S-expressions can so the above declaration can also be expressed as:

{"id": "js.sample.api",
 "require": {"goog.dom":   {"as": "dom"},
             "goog.style": {"as": "style"}}}

Using JSON as a foundation, the META.json system provides a pure JavaScript module metadata system.

Technical Details:
This system can be used to store metadata about individual modules similar to how META.json stores metadata about packages. 

This metadata is later used at compile-time or run-time by source filters which produce optimized versions of your code. The optimized modules use strictly non-blocking IO and they include only the files that are needed.

Available source filters:

Identity - this won't change your module at all
Funcwrap - this just wraps your module in an anonymously executing function giving you lexical scoping
Bundler - this will bundle a standalone version of your module free of any dependencies
Simple - this will output a simple implementation of your module
TransportD - this will output a module that works with CommonJS module transport D

Metaprogramming vs CommonJS Module System
I think this is a superior system to using require, because require doesn't have the same level of accessibility, extensibility, and configurability as JSON. The require proposal just tries to port a statement from popular server-side languages such as Perl and Python to JavaScript rather then building a JavaScripty solution, and it uses a hacked together regular expression trick to make it work well on the client side.
